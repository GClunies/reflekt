    description: Schemas linted to test for naming and meta data conventions.
    columns:
      - name: event_id
        description: Unique identifier for the message collected by the
          Segment call [identify(), group(), page(), screen(), track()].
          Automatically generated by the Segment tracking libraries.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: event_name
        description: Name of the event.
      - name: original_tstamp
        description: Time on the client device when call was invoked; OR
          The timestamp value manually passed in through server-side libraries.
          originalTimestamp is not useful for analysis since it’s not always
          trustworthy as it can be easily adjusted and affected by clock
          skew.
      - name: sent_at_tstamp
        description: Timestamp of when a message is sent to Segment, used
          for clock skew correction. It is set automatically by the Segment
          tracking libraries. sentAt is not useful for analysis since it’s
          not always trustworthy as it can be easily adjusted and affected
          by clock skew.
      - name: received_at_tstamp
        description: Automatically set by Segment, the timestamp of when
          a message is received by Segment. It is set automatically by the
          Segment tracking libraries. Used as sort key in Warehouses when
          loading raw data.
      - name: tstamp
        description: Timestamp when the message itself took place, defaulted
          to the current time by the Segment Tracking API. Used by Segment
          to send to downstream destinations, and used for historical replays.
          Recommended timestamp for analysis when chronology does matter.
      - name: user_id
        description: Unique identifier for the user in your database. A
          userId or an anonymousId is required. See the Identities docs

          of the project name.
      - name: schema_registry

          to.
      - name: call_type
