  - name: checkout_started
    description: User initiated the order process (a transaction is created).
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: Automatically collected by Segment (renamed to `id`
          in data warehouse), a unique identifier for each message that
          lets you find an individual message across the API.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: original_tstamp
        description: Time on the client device when call was invoked; OR
          The timestamp value manually passed in through server-side libraries.
          originalTimestamp is not useful for analysis since it’s not always
          trustworthy as it can be easily adjusted and affected by clock
          skew.
      - name: sent_at
        description: Timestamp of when a message is sent to Segment, used
          for clock skew correction. It is set automatically by the Segment
          tracking libraries. sentAt is not useful for analysis since it’s
          not always trustworthy as it can be easily adjusted and affected
          by clock skew.
      - name: received_at
        description: Automatically set by Segment, the timestamp of when
          a message is received by Segment. It is set automatically by the
          Segment tracking libraries. Used as sort key in Warehouses when
          loading raw data.
      - name: tstamp
        description: Timestamp when the message itself took place, defaulted
          to the current time by the Segment Tracking API. Used by Segment
          to send to downstream destinations, and used for historical replays.
          Recommended timestamp for analysis when chronology does matter.
      - name: anonymous_id
        description: A pseudo-unique substitute for a User ID, for cases
          when you don’t have an absolutely unique identifier. A userId
          or an anonymousId is required. See the Identities docs for more
          details.
      - name: user_id
        description: Unique identifier for the user in your database. A
          userId or an anonymousId is required. See the Identities docs
