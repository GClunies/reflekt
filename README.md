# Reflekt
Reflekt enables Data, Engineering, and Product teams to:
- Define tracking plans as `code` (see [supported tracking plans](https://www.notion.so/reflekt-ci/Reflekt-Docs-a27c2dd7006b4584b6a451819b09cdb7#725dd17834dd4f13b5966c6cbf4e5369)).
- Manage tracking plans using version control and CI/CD.
- Build a dbt package to model and document events in your tracking plan, ready to use in your dbt project.

A Reflekt dbt package includes:
- A dbt [source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources) pointing to the schema and tables in the warehouse where raw event data is loaded.
- A dbt [model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models) for each event in the tracking plan.
- A dbt [doc](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation) for every modeled event that perfectly *reflekts* the tracking plan.

**Product analytics is a team sport.** With Reflekt, your Data, Engineering, and Product teams are aligned on what event data is tracked, how it should be instrumented, how it is modeled, and documentation on what it all means.

## Getting Started
Install Reflekt with `pip`.
```bash
pip install reflekt
```

## Documentation
See the **[Reflekt Docs](https://reflekt-ci.notion.site/Reflekt-Docs-a27c2dd7006b4584b6a451819b09cdb7)** site for documentation on setup, commands, configuration, usage, supported integrations, and demos.

## How it works
At a high level:
- Reflekt connects to the tracking plans in your Analytics Governance tool.
- Reflekt knows the Customer Data Platform (CDP) used to collect your first-party data.
- Reflekt connects to your Data Warehouse.

With these connections, Reflekt knows what events and properties youâ€™ve planned while understanding how your CDP collects event data. Pairing this knowledge with schema, table, and column information pulled from the warehouse, Reflekt can intelligently template dbt models and documentation accordingly.

#### Development environment
reflekt uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management. If you use poetry, this repo includes `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files to help spin up a dev environment.

If you prefer to use another solution (e.g. pipenv, venv, conda) for packaging and dependency management, a `requirements-dev.txt` is included in this repo as well.
